==- The way we record info matters==
- we try to mirror "natural breakages" but there are many ways to make the decisions
- these categories emeerge from our engagement 
I think this idea is echoed well in Bush's article, of the way we record our info. Record information is important and that's the idea behind the memex, storing your info in a way that makes sense and allows your thinking to grow. This idea is also in Kumar's article.
