Caulfield's article made me wonder if Twitter is a reliable space to get your news. I came to a conclusion that it really depends. As someone who uses Twitter, it is the main source for my sports news, I trust the people I follow and understand that they are published journalists who have a reputation. However, in the past, I may see a reply under an original post from a reputable source which spreads misinformation. This post may skew my thinking for a short period before I do my own research, but many people will not take this extra step and simply take the reply as fact.
